        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <p>Nam Dao, Junior Year, Double Major: Economics and Computer Science</p>
        <p>I'm taking this course to learn more about the process of creating the User Interface
            of a website. 
        </p>
        <p>I have taken several classes in the computer science major but, I want to explore the Front-End side of programming.</p>
        <p>My goal for this course is to be able to freely create a website and be able to use some creativity in my designs.</p>
        <p>In Networks, an IP address is used to identify and connect devices to the Internet, and the new standard is IPv6. 
            <br>A domain name is the human-readable version of an IP address. Some basic commands are whois (which identifies the 
            <br>domain owner), ping (which checks the connectivity or time it takes data to move across a network), traceroute 
            <br>(which identifies the nodes along the path to the destination), and curl (which can function for a variety of requests
            <br>from resources on the network such as fetching a resource and displaying it in the shell). In the advanced network tools 
            <br>section, SSH is a tool to connect to other computers on the network. SSH can allow you to edit files, database or pull 
            <br>changes to a git repository on a web server. SFTP allows you to send files across a network. Tcpdump can allow you to 
            <br>monitor network activity or capture data packets.

        <p>Some of the projects that inspire me are "The Size of Space", "The Password Game", and "Where in the USA is this?"
            <br>I found each of these particularly interesting because "The Size of Space" is a pretty interactive way to showcase 
            <br>relative sizing of things. I'm particularly interested in the code behind making the sizes of the different objects 
            <br>proportional to each other. "The Password Game" is a fun interactive game of creating a strong password while having
            <br>to accomplish certain tasks. "Where in the USA is this?" is similar to geoguesser and I'm particularly interested in 
            <br>the creating the map and the zooming in and out of the map.

            Something I found difficult about this assignment was learning the different html syntax as I have to remember to close the  
            <br>different tags before starting new ones or nesting the tags.
